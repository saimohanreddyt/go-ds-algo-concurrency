//Creating Goroutines

//Added the go keyword before each call of function responseSize. The three responseSize goroutines starts up concurrently and three calls to http.Get are made concurrently as well. The program doesn't wait until one response comes back before sending out the next request. As a result the three response sizes are printed much sooner using goroutines.

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"time"
)

func responseSize(url string) {
	fmt.Println("Step1: ", url)
	response, err := http.Get(url)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	fmt.Println("Step2: ", url)
	defer response.Body.Close()

	fmt.Println("Step3: ", url)
	body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(response.Body)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Println("Step4: ", len(body))
}

func main() {
	go responseSize("https://www.golangprograms.com")
	go responseSize("https://coderwall.com")
	go responseSize("https://stackoverflow.com")
	time.Sleep(10 * time.Second)
}
